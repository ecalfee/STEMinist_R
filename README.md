# STEMinist_R

Lessons and exercises for [STEMinist](http://calnerds.berkeley.edu/programs/steminist) R Workshop.
This ~10 hour introduction to R course was developed for UC Berkeley STEMinist, a free data science mentorship and mini-bootcamp program for women and students of color. The STEMinist R Workshop was brought to UC Davis in 2018 and these lessons have been further adapted for students participating in EEGAP UC Davis.

## Using these course materials
This course is designed as a 3-day introduction to R and most of the content focuses on manipulating data and plotting, with more advanced topis (apply, for loops) covered on the 3rd day. All lessons are taught in base R, but exercises could be completed using other common packages (e.g. tidyverse).
Files
  - Lessons (blank lessons as we'd distribute to students and example annotated copies)
  - Short Exercises (completed by student in-between short lessons)
  - Challenge Problems (mini-projects introducing more advanced skills and packages for plotting, simulations, and geospatial analysis)

We recommend instructors 'live-code' in front of the class along with students during the lessons. This way, instructors can demonstrate how to identify and quickly recover from typos and small coding mistakes, an important part of learning how to code. Short 10-15 min lesson chunks are interspersed with exercises, and half or more of the lesson time should be for students to complete these exercise sets, ideally with multiple teaching assistants to help students while they work. Annotated files show the completed file after a full lesson. No homework was assigned and for the second half of the last day students chose one of 3 challenge problems to work on.

Participants were all interested in data science and started the course with a range of coding experience (from undergraduate students with no coding experience to graduate students using Python). We structured the course for mixed abilities by including additional optional harder exercises and by giving students optional 'hints' files for the harder challenge projects at the end of the course.

### Exercise 1.5 - data clean up ------------------------------------------------
# useful commands: duplicated(), is.na(), complete.cases(), !duplicated()

# load the sleep data as in exercise 1.4
# this data describes properties of sleep for different mammals
# column names are:
    # BodyWgt   body weight (kg)
    # BrainWgt  brain weight (g)
    # NonD      slow wave (non-dreaming) sleep (hours/day)
    # Dream     paradoxical (dreaming) sleep (hours/day)
    # Sleep     total sleep (hours/day)
    # Span      maximum life span (years)
    # Gest      gestation time (days)
    # Pred      Predation index (1-5) 1 = minimum (least likely to be preyed upon), 5 = max
    # Exp       sleep exposure index (1-5) 1 = least exposed (sleeps in well-protected den), 5 = most exposed
    # Danger    overall danger index (1-5) 1 = least danger (from other animals), 5 = most danger


#* 01. How many duplicated rows are in the dataset?


# 02. Remove the duplicated rows from the datset


#* 03. Subset the dataset to only include records with data on Gestation period


# 04. Subset the dataset to only include records with data on Dreaming and non dreaming sleep


#* 05. Subset the dataset to only include complete records


# 06. How heavy is the heaviest mammal in the dataset?


#* 07. What is the brain weight of the heaviest individual?


# 08. What are the weights of the animals that share the most common combination of Pred/Exp/Danger? 
#      What is the mean weight of those animals? (This is hard. Don't worry if you don't get it.)

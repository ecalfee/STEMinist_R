# Exercise 1.1 - interacting with R 
# useful functions: c(), ls(), rm(), objects()

### Questions-------------------------------------

#* 01. Open Rstudio and perform an arithmetic calculation in the command line.


#* 02. Create a numeric vector in the command line containing:

        # the numbers 2, 9, 3, 8, and 3 and assign this vector to a global variable x. 

        # Perform arithmetic with x. 

        # Convince yourself R works as a calculator, and knows order of operations. 

        # Multiply x by 10, and save the result as a new object named y
        
        # Calculate the difference in the sum of the x vector and the sum of the y vector


# 03. Call the help files for the functions ls() and rm()

       # What are the arguments for the ls() function?

       # What does the 'sorted' argument do? 


# 04. List all objects in the global environment. 

      # Remove x and y from the global environment.

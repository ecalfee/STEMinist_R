###Day 1 Lesson

## Lines that start with a # will not be executed in R
## So we often start comment lines with a #
## Comments help you to remember what you did and why you did it.
## We recommend you comment profusely!

##### 1.1 ORIENTATION TO R  #####
#################################

## R can be used for basic arithmetic



## It can also store values in variables
 # assign an object using <-, =


 # see that object


 # objects can be numbers, characters


## We can make vectors using c() to concatenate
 # vectors can include numbers


  # we can use colons to get sequences of numbers


 # vectors can include characters (in quotes)


## Manipulating a vector object 
 # We can get summaries of vectors


  # we can see how long a vector is


  # use [] to get parts of vectors


## Operations act on each element of a vector
  # +2


  # *2


  # mean


  # ^2


## Operations can also work with two vectors
  # x + y


  # x * y


## We can keep track of what objects R is using, with the functions ls() and objects()
 # how to get help for a function


 # you can get rid of objects you don't want
  # rm()

 # and make sure it got rid of them


## remember annotate your code! For you and so you can share

##### 1.2 CHARACTERIZE A DATAFRAME #####
########################################

#useful functions: install.packages(), library(), data(), str(), dim(), colnames(), rownames()
                 # class(), as.factor(), as.numeric(), unique(), t(), max(), min(), mean(), summary()


## Install a package; We're going to use the package MASS


## Call library(package)

library("MASS")

## We're going to use data on UScereal
 # load the data (it's called UScereal)


 # See what this data looks like
  # head(), tail()


  # str()


  # data from packages usually has additional info like a function


  # dim(), ncol(), nrow()


  # colnames(), rownames()


  # Rstudio allows us to View() the data



## Classes of data & subsetting datasets
## How to access parts of the data
 # one element


 # one column


 # one row


 # we can look at a single column at a time
  # there are three ways to access this $, [,#], [,"a"]


  # sometimes it is useful to know what class() the column is


 # we can look at a single row at a time
  # there are two ways to access this [#,], ["a",]


## we can select more than one row or column at a time
 # see two columns


 # and make a new data frame from these subsets


## But what if we actually care about how many unique things are in a column?
 # unique()


 # table()


 # levels(), if class is factor



## If your data is transposed in a way that isn't useful to you, you can switch it.
##  note that this often changes the class of each column!
##  In R, each column must have the same type of data
 # t()


## It's important to know the class of data if you want to manipulate it.
##   for example, you can't add characters!
## UScereal is made of many types of data
##   some common classes are: factors, numeric, integers, characters, logical
 # class()


 # str()


## Often we want to summarize data
 # calculate mean() of a column


 # max()


 # min()


 # summary()


## Sometimes, the values we care about aren't provided in a data set
##  When this happens, we can create a new column
  # what if what we cared about was our salt/calorie ratio?


  # add a salt/calorie ratio column


  # look at our dataframe again


           ## EXERCISE 1.2 ##

##### 1.3 SUBSETTING DATASETS & LOGICALS #####
##############################################

# useful commands: "==", "!=", ">", "<", "&", "|", which

# Reminder: assignment operators in R 
 # <-
 # =

## logical conditions vs. assignment operators
 # logical values of TRUE and FALSE are special in R


 # What class is a logical value?


 # Logical values are stored as 0 for FALSE and 1 for TRUE
 #  so you can do math with them
  # sum()


## logicals will be the output of various tests
 # equals


 # does not equal


 # greater than


 # less than


 # combining logical conditions with and (&), or(|)

 
 # we can take the opposite of a logical by using !



### Testing for conditions can be extended to vectors and columns of data frames
 # Which numbers in 1:10 are greater than 3?


 # How many numbers in 1:10 are greater than 3?


 # Which cereals have over 100 calories?


 # Using which() to identify which rows match the logical values (TRUE)


 # Subset rownames() to see which ones match


 # What if I only want to see cereals made by General Mills with 
 #  over 100 calories/cup?


    ### EXERCISE 1.3 ###

##### 1.4 GET DATA INTO R #####
###############################

# useful commands: getwd(), setwd(), read.csv(), list.files()

## We saw earlier how to get data into R from a package,
##  but what if we have a file saved outside of R?
 # first, we need to figure out which directory, a.k.a. folder, R is looking in
  # getwd()


 # we can change this to a useful folder
  # setwd()


  # it's also possible to setwd through the "Session" menu of RStudio


 # Then, we can see which files are in the current directory
  # list.files()


  # Which .csv file is present?


## We can read in csv files with read.csv()
##  and tab delimited files with read.table()
 # read.csv()


 # the option "stringsAsFactors" may be relevant in other datasets
 #  check out how to use it in the help for read.csv()

       #### EXERCISE 1.4 ####

################################
##### 1.5 CLEANING UP DATA #####
################################

# useful commands: duplicated(), is.na(), na.omit(), complete.cases(), duplicated(), !duplicated()


### NAs and missing values
## NA is another special value, like TRUE or FALSE
## it is the placeholder for missing data in R
# check whether a value is NA
 # is.na()


 # add 1 to NA


# we need to treat "NA" differently than other values
# R recognizes this as a numeric, but it is missing data
# this is a a logical -- indicating missing data
 # index of values that are NA


 # index of values that are not NA

 # keep only non-missing values in a vector

 # set missing values to NA 
 # e.g. if "." stands in for missing in your raw data
z = c("Tuesday", "Monday", ".", ".", "Friday")

## One way to clean up data is to remove incomplete rows (those with NAs) from a data.frame
test = data.frame(
  x = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "d"),
  y = c(1, 2, 3, 4, NA))

 # check what this new data frame looks like


 # na.omit()


 # na.exclude() does about the same thing


# Sometimes, we want to know which rows are complete (have no NA values)? 
# complete.cases() - looks along each row, and each column, for NA values


 # Subset the data frame using complete.cases()


## We also might have messy data where rows were recorded multiple times
##  We might want to get rid of these duplicate entries
test2 = data.frame(
  x = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "d"),
  y = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 4))


 # duplicated()


 # isolate duplicated rows


 # index non-duplicated rows


 # remove duplicated rows


## Sometimes, we want to set NA values to zero
 # is.na() and subsetting

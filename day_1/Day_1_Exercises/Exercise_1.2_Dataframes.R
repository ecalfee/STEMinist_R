### Exercise 1.2 - characterize a data frame

# useful commends: [row , col], str(), dim(), nrow(), unique(), length(), rownames(), summary(), min(), max(), 
# mean(), range(), levels(), factor(), as.factor(), class(), ncol(), nrow(), table(), sum(), quantile(), var()

## We'll use the built-in 'iris' dataset

data(iris) # this loads the 'iris' dataset 

# load help file for the 'iris' dataset
?iris
help(iris)

# this calls the object iris
iris 

## If you're not a botanist, remind yourself what an iris looks like

### Questions ------------------------------------------------------------------

#* 01. How many rows are in the dataset?


#  02. What are three distinct ways to figure this out? 


#* 03. How many species of flowers are in the dataset?


# 04. What class is iris?


#* 05. How many columns does this data frame have? What are their names?


#* 06. What class did R assign to each column?


# 07. Assign the first flower's petal's width and length to new objects called setosa1.petalwidth and setosa1.petallength


#* 08. Calculate the approximate area of the petal of the first flower, setosa1 (assume petal area can be approximated by a rectangle).


# 09. Calculate the petal area of each flower in the iris dataset
#        and assign this to a new column named PetalArea.


# 10. What is the maximum sepal length of the irises?


#* 11. What is the average sepal length among flowers in the datset?


# 12. How about the minimum and median sepal length?

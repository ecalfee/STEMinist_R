### Exercise 1.3 - indexing by logical statements
# useful commands:  "==", "!=", ">", "<", "&", "|", sum(), which(), table(), !

### Questions ------------------------------------------------------------------

#* 1. Create your own logical vector with three TRUEs and three FALSEs


#* 2. Produce a vector of the index number of the trueâ€™s


#  3. Produce a second vector which indexes the numbers of the falses


## go back to the iris dataset

#  4. How many irises have sepals less than 5.5 cm?


#* 5. Which iris individual has the largest petal length? What is the width of it's petal? 


#  6.  How many of the irises are in this dataset belong to the species versicolor?


#* 7. How many irises have petals longer than 6cm?


#  8. Create a vector of species name for each iris with sepals longer than 6cm.


#* 9. How many irises have sepals shorter than 5cm, but wider than 3cm?


# 10. How many irises have petals narrower than 0.2cm or shorter than 1.5cm?


# 11. What is the average width of setosa iris sepals that are longer than 5cm?


# 12. What is the difference between the longest and shortest petal lengths of the species virginica?


# 13. What proportion of flowers in the dataset have petals wider than 1cm?


# 14. Create a new column within your dataframe, called sepalCategory, and set all values equal to 'long'
#       Subset short values of this column, and set their values to 'short'
#       (Short sepals are those less than 5.5 cm)
#       How many plants with short sepals are there? How many long?

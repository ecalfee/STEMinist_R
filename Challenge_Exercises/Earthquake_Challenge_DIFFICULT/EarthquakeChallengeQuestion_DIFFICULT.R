#Earthquake challenge question: Should you be worried about earthquakes? Let's make a map. 
#The no hints version

#Make a map in R. Use data from https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/search/ to generate a map of earthquakes. 
#Play around with colors to make your map appealing and readable. 
#How big was the biggest earthquake? Put it on the map with a different symbol and color. 
#Put your home on the map, too, in another different color and symbol. 
#How far was your home from the biggest earthquake? 
#How far are you from the closest earthquake that happened recently? How big was it?
#Put it on the map too (in a different color). 
#How many earthquakes occured within a long days drive of you (500 miles)? How big was the biggest one of these?

#Feel free to ask your own questions, too, but these will get you started. Find your own mapping packages for creating a map (or see hints), but I recommend "geosphere" for calculating distances.
